# compile
# gcc -w option to disable warning messages
gcc -o server.exe server.c -w
./server.exe
gcc -o client.exe client.c -w
./client.exe

# find IP address of website
traceroute www.github.com

# dump traffic on a network 
sudo tcpdump -i any -w attack.pcap

# steps for question 2
1) $sudo tcpdump -i any -w attack.pcap
2) launch server, ./server.exe
3) launch client, ./client.exe
4) client type message test
5) $sudo python2 dosatt.py
6) terminate the tcpdump
7) use wireshark to view the pcap file

# my questions
1) in question 1, why does server must be run as root?
2) do we need the 3.4GB VM image? which part?
