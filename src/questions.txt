Question 1

Create both a client and server program in C. The server must take an input
string and make each letter uppercase. The client must connect to the server
and send a string. As as example see client.py and server.py. 

Note that the server program must be run as root (root password is seed).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2

Perform a Denial of Service (DOS) attack against the server created in question
1. While performing the attack run `sudo  tcpdump -i any -w attack.pcap`.
Spoof a return IP address so that the attack appears to come from somewhere
other than localhost(127.0.0.1).

To create packets for the DOS attack, you may find it helpful to  use python,
scapy, or the scapy python library.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3 

Record all steps of this question using tcpdump (see question 2). 
1:Connect to the website http://www.baiwanzhan.com. 

2:Enter in the search bar any word.

3:Enter in the search bar the word 法轮.

4:Use python to split the GET request up so that the word 法轮 is split up
between two packets.

Examine the packets from steps 2 and 3.
- Open the pcap file with wireshark. 
- Find the packet containing the GET request using the magnifying glass icon to
  search for the benign word from step 2 above.
- Secondary mouse click on the GET request packet and select Follow->TCP stream.
- Observer the Time to Live (TTL) field in the packets sent from the server
  from steps 2 and 3 (you may have to clear the search in wireshark to find the
  packets associated with step 3).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4

Examine the pcap files and write up what is happening at each
step of question 2 and 3.
